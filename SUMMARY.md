# Project Debugging Summary

## What We've Done:

1.  **Initial Problem:** The Telegram bot was not sending questions, despite the GitHub Actions workflow showing a successful run.
2.  **Investigation & Debugging:**
    *   Confirmed project structure and file contents.
    *   Verified that Telegram bot credentials (token, chat IDs) were correctly set as GitHub secrets and were functional via a manual `curl` test.
    *   Added detailed debug logging to `send_daily_questions.py`.
    *   Analyzed GitHub Actions logs, which revealed a `RuntimeWarning: coroutine 'Bot.send_message' was never awaited`. This indicated that the asynchronous Telegram API calls were not being handled correctly.
3.  **Implemented Asynchronous Fix:**
    *   Modified `send_daily_questions.py` to make the `send_questions` function asynchronous (`async def`).
    *   Added `await` keywords before `bot.send_message` calls.
    *   Updated the main execution block to use `asyncio.run()`. 
4.  **Current Status:** Questions are now successfully being sent to Telegram.

## What Needs To Be Done:

1.  **Problem:** The options for the multiple-choice questions are not appearing correctly in the Telegram messages.
2.  **Root Cause:** Upon inspection of `mcqs.json`, it was found that many question options are malformed (e.g., contain extra text, are empty, or are truncated). The bot sends exactly what it reads from this file.
3.  **Action Required (Manual):**
    *   **Manually edit the `mcqs.json` file** in a text editor.
    *   Go through each question and carefully **correct all malformed options**. Ensure each option is a clean, accurate string.
    *   **Save** the corrected `mcqs.json` file.
    *   **Commit and push** the updated `mcqs.json` to your GitHub repository. This will trigger a new GitHub Actions run, and the questions should then be sent with correctly formatted options.
