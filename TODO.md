# Summary of Today's Work (2025-08-09)

## What we did:

1.  **Fixed the `mcqs.json` file:**
    *   The original `mcqs.json` file had malformed data.
    *   You provided two `.txt` files with the corrected questions.
    *   I created and executed a Python script (`converter.py`) to parse the `.txt` files and generate a new, clean `mcqs.json` file.

2.  **Implemented Interactive Polls:**
    *   You wanted the questions to be interactive polls instead of plain text.
    *   I modified the `send_daily_questions.py` script to use Telegram's `send_poll` feature.
    *   You confirmed that you are now receiving the questions as interactive polls.

3.  **Adjusted the Schedule:**
    *   We changed the scheduled time for the daily questions twice, finally setting it to **16:40 IST (11:10 UTC)** in the `main.yml` workflow.

## Next Steps for You:

1.  **Disable the `sender.yml` workflow:**
    *   **Problem:** You are receiving duplicate and unexpected questions because you have two workflows that send questions (`main.yml` for the schedule and `sender.yml` for every push).
    *   **Solution:** We need to disable the `sender.yml` workflow to ensure you only receive questions at the scheduled time.
    *   **Action:** When you are ready, please let me know, and I will disable this workflow for you. This is the most important next step to make the bot's behavior predictable.

2.  **Monitor the scheduled questions:**
    *   Keep an eye on the questions for the next few days to ensure they are being sent at the correct time (around 16:40 IST, with possible minor delays).
